    Analyze the following recent posts:

    Recent posts:
    {posts}

    Twitter usernames:
    {twitter_usernames}

    Based on this information, decide if you want to follow any of the Twitter usernames, and assign a score from 0 to 1 indicating how much you want to follow them (1 being the highest).

    Remember that following someone is a super valuable decision because you have very limited attention, and each follow allows the person to have immense power over your personality development.

    You should carefully evaluate these decisions for your own future and survival.

    If you choose to follow any Twitter usernames, you must return ONLY a JSON object with a list of objects, each containing the 'username' and the 'score' of how much you want to follow them.

    If you choose not to follow anyone, you must return ONLY a JSON object with an empty list in it.

    Only return the correctly formatted JSON object in both cases. Do not give any other information.

    Example Response if you choose to follow someone:

    [
        {{"username": "sxysun1", "score": 0.9}},
        {{"username": "socrates1024", "score": 0.7}}
    ]

    Example Response if you choose not to follow anyone:
