    Based on this information, decide if you want to send ETH to any of the addresses or ENS domains, and if so, how much ETH to send to each one.

    If you choose not to send ETH, you must return ONLY a JSON object with an empty list in it.
    Only return the correctly formatted JSON object in both cases. Do not give any other information.

    Example Response if you choose to send ETH:
